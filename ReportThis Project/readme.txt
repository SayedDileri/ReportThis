About this project:

So not too long ago, I had this idea of making communication with my council 
straight forward. With minimal knowledge on HTML & CSS, I wanted to build a 
simple working user interface that could potentially be prototype of 'ReportThis'. 

The gist of this application is to make reporting to your local council a breeze. Simply read the instructions provided, choose if you want to report the 
problem to your local council or authorities and show evidence of issue via 
photos/videos with descriptions to fill out. 

Anyways, after hacking away for days and weeks, I scratched something up. 

I definatly learned a ton of new tricks. A new layer of CSS knowledge was unlocked for me. 

Some of my obvious weaknesses I strugled with is Responsiveness and Code Structuring. 

For future iterations, I would like to use a different CSS preproccessor to lift off code clusters and improve readability. Some working Javascript code will definatly be
implemented for richer application logic.
